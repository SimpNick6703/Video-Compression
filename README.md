# Video-Compression
**Discord compliant file size limit video compression:**
Discord has too small file size limit for free. And, any online video compressor as cloud service or standalone installer ones have either file upload limit or too many options to configure and we never know what's the optimal configuration to go with.

A normal user isn't curious about these configuration and just want a _targeted file size_ video compression with minimal quality loss.

So, here's a simple drag and drop usage (In Windows) easy solution.

## How to use
- In Windows:
  - Download any of the target filesize build from [releases](<https://github.com/SimpNick6703/Video-Compression/releases>).
  - Drag and drop your video on the executable. (Or run in Command Prompt/Terminal as `./{size}mb-win64 <input.mp4> [output.mp4]`)

- In Linux:
  - Download your desired build from [releases](<https://github.com/SimpNick6703/Video-Compression/releases>).
  - Make your downloaded file executable: `chmod +x {size}mb-linux`
  - Run in terminal as `./{size}mb-linux <input.mp4> [output.mp4]`
